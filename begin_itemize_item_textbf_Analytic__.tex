\item \textbf{Analytic}: Analyticity is the property for a function to be \verb|differentiable| at \verb|all points| in a certain domain (i.e., not only at one point).
\begin{quote}
A function $f(z)$ is said to be analytic \verb|at a point $z$| if $z$ is an \verb|interior point| of some region where $f(z)$ is analytic.
